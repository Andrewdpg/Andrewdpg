### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm AndrÃ©s, a Systems Engineering student from Universidad Icesi in Colombia. I was drawn here by the idea of creating things, which feels almost like a superpower, and that's what I plan to keep doing. As a developer, I would love to create solutions that can make a positive impact on people's lives, even in small ways. There's something incredibly fulfilling about transforming an idea into a real working thing through code.

When I'm not buried academic work or coding on my own projects, you'll likely find me gaming, watching a movie or anime, or taking on coding challenges to keep my problem-solving skills sharp.
